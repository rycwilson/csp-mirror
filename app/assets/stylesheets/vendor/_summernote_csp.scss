 * this is a fix for summernote's link dialog modal, which opens inside the contributor invitation modal
 * note a change was made to summernote to add 'modal-open' class to body when link dialog closes
 * (search for 'csp' in summernote code)
 * in addition, below is required to stop the background from scrolling while the invitation modal is still open
 *
 * (update: apparently this fix was removed)
